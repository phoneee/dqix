## Internet Governance Framework for Domain Quality Assessment

DQIX implements comprehensive domain quality assessment based on established **internet governance principles** and **multistakeholder frameworks** as outlined by the [Harvard Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2014/internet_governance) and [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/policybriefs/internetgovernance/).

### Framework Foundation

The assessment framework employs a **decentralized, collaborative evaluation model** following internet governance best practices:

- **Multistakeholder Approach**: Based on Harvard Berkman Klein Center research on collaborative governance groups
- **Internet Standards Compliance**: IETF RFCs for technical specifications  
- **Security Frameworks**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework integration
- **Accessibility Standards**: W3C WCAG compliance
- **Best Practices**: Internet Society governance recommendations

### Getting Started

For installation, usage examples, and comprehensive documentation, see the main [README](../README.md).
