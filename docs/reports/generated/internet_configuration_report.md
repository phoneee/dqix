## Key Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Industry Patterns

- **Financial sector**: 40.5% average - Needs improvement in security configuration
- **Government sites**: 39.3% average - Significant room for improvement
- **Technology companies**: 38.0% average - Surprisingly low for tech sector

### 2. Common Security Gaps

- **Security Headers**: Major gap across all sectors - only 25.0% average
- **TLS Configuration**: Many sites using outdated protocols - 0.0% average

### 3. Regional Observations
