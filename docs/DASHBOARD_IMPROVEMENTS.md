### 2. **Color Psychology**
- Green indicates success and security
- Yellow/amber indicates caution and areas for improvement
- Red indicates critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Blue is used for informational elements and navigation

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Essential information is immediately visible
- Additional details are available through interaction
- Complex technical data is organized in expandable sections

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach ensures usability on all devices
- Flexible grid system adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements for mobile devices
