# Internet Observability Platform (DQIX) - Principles & Measurement Framework

## Vision Statement
*"Measuring the health of the Internet, together, in the open."*

The **Internet Observability Platform (DQIX)** provides comprehensive, transparent, and reproducible measurement of Internet infrastructure security, accessibility, and governance compliance using exclusively open data and academic standards.

## Core Internet Observability Principles

### 1. **Open Internet Standards Compliance**
Based on internationally recognized frameworks:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk management and security controls
- **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security risks  
- **RFC Standards** - Internet engineering protocols (TLS, DNS, HTTP, SMTP)
- **W3C Web Standards** - Accessibility and web best practices
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management principles

### 2. **Transparent Measurement Methodology**
- All measurement algorithms are public and auditable
- Scoring criteria based on published security research
- No proprietary or black-box scoring methods
- Reproducible results using open data sources
- Real-time Internet health monitoring

### 3. **Evidence-Based Internet Assessment**
- Measurements derived from actual technical implementation
- Quantifiable security and compliance indicators
- Peer-reviewed security research foundations
- Real-world attack vector considerations
- Continuous Internet infrastructure monitoring

Overall Score = Sum of all successful probe scores / Number of successful probes
```
