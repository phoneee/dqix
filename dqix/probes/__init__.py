"""Re-export the probe registry from :pymod:`dqix.core`.

This avoids diverging registries while we transition to the
probe-centric package layout. All probes should import the
``register`` decorator from ``dqix.probes`` â€“ which simply forwards
to the canonical implementation in :pymod:`dqix.core`.

# Nothing else is defined here on purpose. New probes placed under
# ``dqix/probes/`` should do ``from . import register`` so they end up in
# the single global registry consumed by the CLI.
